-- 1. Column check — expect 4 rows back (manager_id, manager_decision_at,
--    manager_comment, admin_comment). If you get fewer, the migration
--    hasn't run (or only partially ran).

-- 2. Status default check — expect 'PENDING_MANAGER'::character varying.
--    If it still shows 'pending', the ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT hasn't run.
SELECT column_default

WHERE table_name = 'access_requests' AND column_name = 'status';

-- 3. Any rows still stuck in the old vocabulary (pending/approved/denied)?
--    Should return 0 rows after the migration's backfill UPDATEs.

-- 4. 'manager' role present? (inserted by the migration, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)
